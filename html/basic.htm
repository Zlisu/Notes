        <h2 id="part 4">4. Quatation and Citation</h2>
        <p>Sir Winston Churchill said <q>To improve is to change, so to be perfect is to have changed oftern.</q></p>
        <p>Use &lt;cite&gt; for the <b>title</b> and &lt;blockquote&gt; for the <b>body</b> of the work you cited. 
            For example, here is a quote from <cite>You and the Atomic Bomb</cite> by George Owell.</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://orwell.ru/library/articles/ABomb/english/e_abomb">
                Considering how likely we all are to be blown to pieces by it within the next five years, the atomic bomb has not roused so much 
                discussion as might have been expected. The newspapers have published numerous diagrams, not very helpful to the average 
                man, of protons and neutrons doing their stuff, and there has been much reiteration of the useless statement that the bomb ‘ought to be put under 
                international control.’ But curiously little has been said, at any rate in print, about the question that is of most urgent interest to all of us, 
                namely: ‘How difficult are these things to manufacture?’
