Social Psychology

# Chapter 1	Introducing Social Psychology

## What are social psychology's big ideas?

1. We Construct Our Social Reality

People have an irresistible urge to explain behavior, to attribute it to some cause, and therefore to make it seem orderly, predictable, and controllable. You and I may react differently to a situation because we think differently. 

举个例子，如果女朋友发脾气，你认为发脾气因为她作还是因为她今天过的不顺利，会导致你对她发脾气做出不同的反应。

**The conclusion: There is an objective reality out there, but we always view it through the lens of our beliefs and values.**

2. Our Social Intuitions Are Often Powerful but Sometimes Perilous

But in others, in which accuracy matters—such as when needing to fear the right things and spend our resources wisely—we had best restrain our impulsive intuitions with critical thinking. Our intuitions and unconscious information processing are routinely powerful and sometimes perilous.

# Chapter 2	The Self in a Social World

## Spotlights and Illusions

<u>spotlight effect:</u>

The belief that others are paying more attention to our appearance and behavior than they really are. 别人并不会像你自己以为的那样那么注意你。

<u>illusion of transparency:</u>

The illusion that our concealed emotions leak out and can be easily read by others. 你自己以为自己的心情情绪好像是明摆着的，但其实别人并不会像你以为的那样自然而然的感知到你的喜怒哀乐。

## Self-Concept: Who am I?

### At the Center of  Our  Worlds: Our Sense of  Self

**self-concept:** What we know and believe about ourselves.

**self-schema:** Beliefs about self that organize and guide the processing of self-relevant information.

Our self-schemas—our perceiving ourselves as athletic, overweight, smart, or anything else—powerfully affect how we perceive, remember, and evaluate other people and ourselves.

你更容易注意到以及记得和你对自己的认知关联较大的事情或者东西。比如说如果你自己天天健身，那别人提到运动健身减肥之类的话题你就更容易记得。

#### Social Comparisons

<u>social comparison:</u> Evaluating one’s abilities and opinions by comparing oneself with others.

**Much of life revolves around social comparisons. Sometimes social comparison is based on incomplete information.** This biased social comparison might be one reason young adults who used Facebook more often were more anxious, more lonely, and less satisfied with their lives. 

生活中经常通过拿自己与别人相比较来评价自己，但这种比较通常是基于不完整的信息的，所以得到的感觉是不真实的。

When climbing the ladder of success, we tend to look up, not down; we compare ourselves with others doing even better.

### Self and Culture

<u>Individualism:</u> The concept of giving priority to one’s own goals over group goals and defining one’s identity in terms of personal attributes rather than group identifications.

<u>Collectivism:</u> Giving priority to the goals of one’s group (often one’s extended family or work group) and defining one’s identity accordingly.

<u>Independent self:</u> Construing one’s identity as an autonomous self.

个人对自己的认知受社会环境的影响。西方个人主义与东方集体主义下，个人对自己的认知和定义明显不同。

### Self-Knowledge

#### Predicting Our Behavior

人对发生在自己身上的事的预测通常不太准。

<u>Planning fallacy</u>: The tendency to underestimate how long it will take to complete a task.

#### Predicting our feelings

Studies of “affective forecasting” reveal that people have greatest difficulty predicting
the intensity and the duration of their future emotions. 

<u>Impact bias</u>: overestimating the enduring impact of emotion-causing events. 

We are especially prone to impact bias after negative events. 人对负面事件给自己带来负面情绪的预测尤其不准。 

- 人在设想发生负面事件的时候，会focus on 这个负面事件。 而当负面事件真正发生以后，人还是会有很多注意力放在生活中的方方面面，而不会一门心思只想这个负面事件。

- People neglect the speed and the power of their coping mechanisms, which include rationalizing, discounting, forgiving, and limiting emotional trauma. 

#### The Wisdom and Illusions of Self-Analysis

Analyzing why we feel the way we do can actually make our judgments less accurate. In nine experiments, Wilson and colleagues found that the attitudes people consciously expressed toward things or people usually predicted their subsequent behavior reasonably well. Their attitude
reports *became useless*, however, if participants *were first asked to analyze* their feelings.

**Dual attitude system:** Our **automatic implicit, unconscious attitudes** regarding someone or
something often differ from our **consciously controlled, explicit attitudes**. When someone says they make decisions by “trusting my gut,” they’re referring to their implicit attitudes.

由此可知： Even if people report and interpret their experiences with complete honesty, that does not mean their reports are true.

## Self-Esteem

<u>self-esteem</u>: A person’s overall self-evaluation or sense of self-worth.

Specific self-perceptions do have some influence, however. If you think you’re good at math, you will be more likely to do well at math. 

**If you want to encourage someone (or yourself!), it’s better if your praise is specific (“You’re good at math”) instead of general (“You’re great”) and if your kind words reflect true ability and performance (“You really improved on your last test”) rather than unrealistic optimism (“You can do anything”). Feedback is best when it is true and specific.**

Struggling students told to feel good about themselves, the researchers muse, may have thought, “I’m already great—why study?” 如果明明做的不好你还夸他，那他就不会觉得有改进的必要，所以也就不会变得更好了。

### Self-Esteem Motivation

Most people are extremely motivated to maintain their self-esteem.

self-esteem 低的人更容易对别人的不幸幸灾乐祸。

当Self-esteem 受到威胁时：

1. 当两兄弟中的一个比另一个明显在某方面强，那这两兄弟通常相处的不会太好。

2. 你朋友比你成功，比陌生人比你更成功更能使你感到self-esteem being threaten. 

3. Self-esteem level also makes a difference

- High self-esteem people usually react to a self-esteem threat by compensating for it (blaming someone else or trying harder next time). These reactions help them preserve their positive feelings about themselves. 
- Low self-esteem people, however, are more likely to blame themselves or give up 

However, **actively pursuing self-esteem can backfire**. Jennifer Crocker and colleagues found that students whose self-worth was contingent on external sources (such as grades or others’ opinions) experienced more stress, anger, relationship problems, drug and alcohol use, and eating disorders than did those whose sense of self-worth was rooted more in internal sources, such as personal virtues 

如果你的self-esteem 更多的来源于外部（比如成绩、别人的认可），那你比从自身内在美德获得 self-esteem 的人更容易出现压力、易怒、酗酒等问题。

When we focus on boosting our self-esteem, we may become less open to criticism, less likely to empathize with others, and more pressured to succeed at activities rather than enjoy them. Over time, such pursuit of self-esteem can fail to satisfy our deep needs for competence, affiliation, and
autonomy. 解决办法：

- 不要只想着和别人比较，可以对别人更善意、更有同情心
- self-compassion—leaving behind comparisons with others and instead treating ourselves with kindness

### The Trade-off of Low vs. High Self-Esteem

#### Narcissism

Most people with high self-esteem value both individual achievement and relationships with others. Narcissists usually have high self-esteem, but they are missing the piece about caring for others.

Narcissists are especially likely to lash out when the insult is delivered publicly—and thus punctures their carefully constructed bubble of superiority. 

### Self-Efficacy

<u>Self-efficacy</u>: A sense that one is competent and effective, distinguished from self-esteem, which is one’s sense of self-worth. A sharpshooter in the military might feel high self-efficacy and low self-esteem.

Self-efficacy and self-esteem sound similar but are different concepts. If you **believe you can do something**, that’s **self-efficacy**. If you like yourself overall, that’s self-esteem.

Children and adults with strong feelings of self-efficacy are more persistent, less anxious, and less depressed. They also live healthier lives and are more academically successful.

In everyday life, **self-efficacy leads us to set challenging goals and to persist.** When problems arise, a strong sense of self-efficacy leads people to stay calm and seek solutions rather than ruminate on their inadequacy. Competence plus persistence equals accomplishment. And with accomplishment, self-confidence grows. Self-efficacy, like self-esteem, grows with hard-won achievements.

**该怎么夸小孩儿**：One study showed that self-efficacy feedback (“You tried really hard”) led to better performance than self-esteem feedback (“You’re really smart”). 你夸他聪明，他会担心下回没办法还是表现得很聪明。但你夸他努力，他以后会更努力。

## Self-Serving Bias

**Self-serving bias:** a tendency to perceive oneself favorably.

1. Self-serving attributions: A form of self-serving bias; the tendency to attribute positive outcomes to oneself and negative outcomes to other factors.
2. Comparing oneself favorably to others: I do more for my parents than my sister
   does.
3. Unrealistic optimism: Even though 50% of marriages fail, I know
   mine will be enduring joy.
4. False consensus and uniqueness: I know most people agree with me that
   global warming threatens our future.

### False Consensus and Uniqueness

<u>False consensus effect</u>: the tendency to overestimate the commonality of one’s opinions and one’s undesirable or unsuccessful behaviors.

- 以为别人的想法都和自己一致
- 以为别人的做法都和自己一致。比如自己避税，就以为别人也都普遍避税。

<u>False uniqueness effect</u>: the tendency to underestimate the commonality of one’s abilities and one’s desirable or successful behaviors. 在自己比较得意的地方，比如某项能力，就以为自己这一点上很独有很与众不同。

## How Do people Manage Their Self-Presentation

### Self-Handicapping

Recall that we eagerly protect our self-images by attributing failures to external factors. Thus, fearing failure, people might handicap themselves by partying half the night before a job interview
or playing video games instead of studying before a big exam. When self-image is tied up with performance, it can be more self-deflating to try hard and fail than to procrastinate and have a ready excuse.

Handicaps protect both self-esteem and public image by allowing us to attribute failures to something temporary or external (“I was feeling sick”; “I was out too late the night before”) rather than to lack of talent or ability.

### Self-monitoring

Being attuned to the way one presents oneself in social situations and adjusting one’s performance to create the desired impression.

## Self-Control

自我控制消耗意志力，人的自制力是有限的。在一件事情上为自制付出的努力越多，同时在另一件事上就越难自控。

Effortful self-control depletes our limited willpower reserves. Self-control therefore operates similarly to muscular strength: Both are weaker after exertion, replenished with rest, and strengthened by exercise

但是你在一件事上培养出了自制力，那么你这个人的自制力就得到了增强，以后在另一件事上就会有更强的自制力。所以不要一次性的同时强迫自己在多件事上控制自己，而应该一次只在一件事上努力，提高自己的意志力，完成以后再去攻克下一件事。

So if you’d like to increase your willpower, don’t make a long list of New Year’s resolutions and tackle them all at once in January. A better strategy, the research suggests, is to start with one area and then let your increased self-control spread throughout your newly improved life. 



# Chapter 3	Social Beliefs and Judgements

## How do we judge our social worlds, consciously and unconsciously?

We have two brain systems:

* **System 1** functions automatically and out of our awareness (often called “intuition” or a “gut feeling”)
* **System 2** requires our conscious attention and effort

### Priming

Our memory system is a web of associations, and **priming** is the awakening or activating
of certain associations. Experiments show that priming one thought, even without awareness,
can influence another thought, or even an action 

周围环境中细微到让你意识不到的东西，会通过影响system 1 而影响你对其他事务的认知。例子： An imperceptibly flashed word, “bread,” may prime people to detect a related word, such as “butter,” more quickly than they detect an unrelated word, such as “bottle” or “bubble” 

Much of our social information processing is automatic. It is unintentional, out of sight, and happens without our conscious ­awareness—relying on System 1

Even physical sensations, thanks to our **embodied cognition**, prime our social judgments
and vice versa。 例子：People who ate alone judged room temperature as colder than those who ate with others

### Intuitive Judgments

#### The powers of intuition

Our thinking is partly automatic (impulsive, effortless, and without our awareness—System 1) and partly controlled (reflective, deliberate, and conscious—System 2). Automatic, intuitive thinking occurs not “onscreen” but offscreen, out of sight, where reason does not go.  

Some things—facts, names, and past experiences—we remember explicitly (consciously)
using System 2. But other things—skills and conditioned dispositions—we remember
implicitly with System 1.

#### The limits of intuition

The unconscious may not be as smart as previously believed:
* error-prone hindsight
* Illusory intuition

### Overconfidence

Overconfidence: The tendency to be more confident than correct—to overestimate the accuracy of one’s beliefs.

People frequently cut things too close—arriving late, missing planes, or bouncing checks. In
thinking we know exactly how something will go, we too often miss the window.

Why does overconfidence persist? Perhaps because we like those who are confident: Group members rewarded highly confident individuals with higher status—even when their confidence was not justified by actual ability. Overconfident individuals spoke first, talked longer, and used a more factual tone, making them appear more competent than they
actually were. Even when groups worked together repeatedly and learned that the overconfident individuals were not as accurate as presented, group members continued to accord them status.

#### Confirmation bias

We are eager to verify our beliefs but less inclined to seek evidence that might disprove them, a phenomenon called the confirmation bias.

Confirmation bias appears to be a System 1 snap judgment, where our default reaction is to look for information consistent with our presupposition. Stopping and thinking a little—calling up System 2—makes us less likely to commit this error.

#### Remedies for overconfidence

be wary of other people’s dogmatic statements. Even when people are sure they are right, they may be wrong. Confidence and competence need not coincide.

When people think about why an idea might be true, it begins to seem true. Thus, a third way to reduce overconfidence is to get people to think of one good reason why their judgments might be wrong; that is, force them to consider disconfirming information. Managers might foster more realistic judgments by insisting that all proposals and recommendations include reasons why they might not work.

Still, we should be careful not to undermine people’s reasonable self-confidence or to
destroy their decisiveness.



### Heuristics: Mental Shortcuts

Heuristics enable us to make routine decisions with minimal effort

Representativeness heuristic: The tendency to presume, sometimes despite contrary odds, that someone or something belongs to a particular group if resembling (representing) a typical member.

Availability heuristic: A cognitive rule that judges the likelihood of things in terms of their availability in memory. If instances of something come readily to mind, we presume it to be commonplace.

The availability heuristic explains why vivid, easy-to-imagine events, such as shark attacks or diseases with easy-to-picture symptoms, may seem more likely to occur than harder-to-picture events . Likewise, powerful anecdotes can be more compelling than statistical information. In short, **we worry about remote possibilities while ignoring higher probabilities**, a phenomenon that social scientists call our “probability neglect.”



### Counterfactual Thinking

Counterfactual thinking: Imagining alternative scenarios and outcomes that might have happened, but didn’t.

Such counterfactual thinking—imagining what could have been—occurs when we can
easily picture an alternative outcome 

Example: If we barely miss a plane or a bus, we imagine making it if only we had left at our
usual time, taken our usual route, or not paused to talk. If we miss our connection
by a half hour or after taking our usual route, it’s harder to simulate a ­different
outcome, so we feel less frustration.

**Most people, however, live with more regret over things they didn’t do than what they**
did, such as, “I should have told my father I loved him before he died”** or “I wish I had
been more serious in college”. Would we live with less regret if we dared more often to reach
beyond our comfort zone—to venture out, risking failure, but at least having tried?

### Illusory Thinking

#### Illusory correlation

Illusory correlation: Perception of a relationship where none exists, or perception of a stronger
relationship than actually exists.

 If we believe that premonitions correlate with events, we notice and remember any joint occurrence of the premonition and the event’s later occurrence. We ignore or forget all the times unusual events do not coincide.

Regression toward the average: The statistical tendency for extreme scores or extreme
behavior to return toward one’s average.
