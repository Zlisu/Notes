## The Effective Decision

They know that the most time-consuming step in the process is not making the decision but putting it into effect. unless a decision has degenerated into work, it is not a decision; it is at best a good intention.

### Sequential Steps

#### The Classification

**4 types of events**

- A truly **generic event**, of which the **individual occurrence is only a symptom**
- The problem which, while unique event for the individual institution, is actulally generic
- The **truly exceptional event** that the executive must distinguish
- An event that looks an exception but in fact an **early manifestation of a new generic proble**m

**All events but the truly unique require a generic solution.**

By far the most common mistake of the decision maker is to treat a generic situation as if it were a series of unique events-that is, to be pragmatic when lacking the generic undersstanding and principle. The inevitable result is frustration and futility.

Equally common is the mistake of treating a new event as if it were just another example of the old problem to which, therefore, the old rules should be applied.
