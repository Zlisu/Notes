Visualization Goals

Effective Visualizations

- Have graphical integrity
- keep it simple
- use the right display
- use color strategically
- tell a story with data

Bar chart has to start from 0 x axis. Line chart not based on 0 is OK, but you need to highlight that.

Use histogram to show distribution; play with bin size to discover pattern.
